# Global_Optimization_Lib

The `global_optimization` package is a Python library designed for restoration of global optimization algorithms.

## Currently restored:
​	`ga`: `src/ga/ga.py`  
  `ssw`: `src/ssw/main.py`  
  `asop`: `src/asop/asop.py`  
  
## Tips
  The current `asop` module is in progressing !  
​	If necessary, this library will include more global optimization methods.
